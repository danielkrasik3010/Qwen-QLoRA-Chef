Smooth the top of the filling with a spatula.\n3. Refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow the filling to set.\n\n**Step 5: Serve**\n\n1. Serve the pie chilled, garnished with additional shredded coconut if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* To prevent the crust from shrinking, make sure to keep it chilled and handle it gently.\n* If you find that the filling is too thick, you can thin it out with a little more milk or cream.\n* You can also use a pie shield or pie weights to prevent the crust from browning during baking."}

Sprinkle a layer of grated Parmesan cheese on top of the Mozzarella.\n7. **Repeat the layers:** Repeat the layers two more times, ending with a layer of cheese on top.\n8. **Bake:** Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Bake the Eggplant Parmesan for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n9. **Serve:** Remove from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves, if desired.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* To prevent the eggplant from becoming too greasy, make sure to not overcrowd the skillet when frying.\n* If you want a crisper crust on the eggplant, you can broil the Parmesan for an additional 1-2 minutes after baking.\n* You can also add some chopped onions, garlic, or other herbs to the spaghetti sauce for extra flavor.\n\nEnjoy your delicious Eggplant Parmesan!"}

If using frozen grapes, let them thaw and pat dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.\n2. **Combine Grapes and Water:** In a large pot, combine the grapes and water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally.\n3. **Reduce Heat and Simmer:** Reduce the heat to low and simmer the grape mixture for about 20-25 minutes, or until the grapes have broken down and the liquid has reduced slightly. You can help the process by mashing the grapes with a potato masher or the back of a spoon.\n4. **Add Sugar:** Stir in the granulated sugar until it's fully dissolved. You can use a potato masher or a wooden spoon to mash the sugar into the grape mixture.\n5. **Simmer and Reduce:** Continue to simmer the mixture for another 10-15 minutes, or until the syrup has thickened and reduced to your desired consistency. You can test the syrup by drizzling a small amount on a plate and letting it cool to room temperature. If it's still too runny, continue to simmer for a few more minutes.\n6. **Strain the Syrup:** Remove the pot from the heat and let the syrup cool slightly. Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any remaining grape solids.\n7. **Store the Syrup:** Transfer the syrup to glass jars with tight-fitting lids and store them in the refrigerator. The syrup will thicken further as it cools, so it's best to use it within a few weeks.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use a candy thermometer to check the syrup's temperature. It should reach 230\u00b0F (110\u00b0C) for a perfect syrup.\n* If you prefer a clearer syrup, you can add a small amount of cornstarch or gelatin to help thicken it.\n* Experiment with different flavor combinations by adding a few slices of citrus fruits, such as orange or lemon, to the grape mixture before simmering.\n* This syrup is great for topping ice cream, yogurt, or using as a sweetener in baked goods.
