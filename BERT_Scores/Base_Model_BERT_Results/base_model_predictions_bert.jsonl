If using, sprinkle more cheese on top before folding.\n\n8. **Bake:** Place the enchiladas seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n9. **Serve:** Remove from the oven and let them cool for a minute.

Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.\n- Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 15 minutes until the grapes are soft but not mushy. This process is called \"saut\u00e9eing\" in some regions.\n\n**Step 3: Add Sugar and Pectin (if using)**\n- Once the grapes are cooked, remove the pot from the heat. Let it cool slightly.\n- Stir in the sugar and pectin (if using). The sugar should dissolve completely; if there are lumps, you can use a whisk to help it mix better.\n- If desired, add the lemon juice at this stage to enhance the flavor of the jelly.\n\n**Step 4: Thicken the Jelly**\n- Return the pot to medium-low heat. Use a wooden spoon or silicone spatula to gently stir the mixture continuously.\n- Continue stirring until the mixture thickens to your desired consistency. For most recipes, this takes around 10-15 minutes. You'll know it's done when the mixture coats the back of a spoon without leaving streaks.\n\n**Step 5: Cool and Store**\n- Once the jelly has thickened, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit undisturbed for about 5 minutes to allow the gelatinous texture to set up.\n- Pour the jelly into clean jars, leaving about 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth to ensure they're dry before sealing.\n- Place the jars in a pan filled with boiling water to sterilize them.
